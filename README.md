# 📦 .NET SDK vs .NET RUNTIME

---

## 🧰 What is the .NET SDK?

The **.NET SDK (Software Development Kit)** is used do **build and develop** .NET applications.

### The .NET SDK includes : 
 - The **.NET Runtime**
 - **Compilers**
 - **.NET CLI tools** (`dotnet` command)
 - **Project templates**
 - **Build tools**

### When do you need it?
 - Creating new projects: `dotnet new console`
 - Building apps: `dotnet build`
 - Running apps during development: `dotnet run`

> 📌 Install the SDK if you are a **developer**.

## ⚙ What is the .NET Runtime 

The **.NET Runtime** is what is required to **run a .NET application** after is build.  It is required so that an operating system can **run a .NET application**. It **does not include build tools**, so it's meant for **running applications**, not for developing them.


### It includes :
 - The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**
 - Base libraries 

### ❌ It does **not include** :
 - Compilers 
 - SDK tools 
 - Project Templates 

### When do you need it?
If you have a pre-built app (e.g., `dll`) and just want to run it: ``dotnet MyApp.dll``

The C# compiler (named Roslyn) used by the dotnet CLI tool converts your C# source code into intermediate language (IL) code and stores the IL in an assembly (a DLL or EXE file)

**The Common Language Runtime(CLR) it's what actually executes your .NET applications.**

# ⚙️ Common Language Runtime (CLR)

The **Common Language Runtime(CLR)** it's what actually executes your .NET applications, managing critical services like memory, security, and exception handling.

## 🚀 What Does the CLR Do?

| Feature                 | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 🔄 Code Execution       | Runs Intermediate Language (IL) code by converting it to native code using **JIT (Just-In-Time)** compilation. |
| 🗑️ Memory Management    | Uses **Garbage Collection (GC)** to automatically free unused memory. |
| 🔐 Security             | Enforces code access permissions and sandboxing where needed. |
| 🧪 Type Safety          | Ensures that data types are used correctly and safely. |
| 📦 Exception Handling   | Provides a unified error-handling mechanism across all .NET languages. |
| 🌐 Interoperability     | Allows .NET code to interact with unmanaged code (e.g., C++, COM). |
| 🔍 Metadata & Reflection | Supports runtime inspection of types and assemblies. |

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. ✅ You write code in C# (or any .NET-supported language)
2. 🧱 It is compiled into **IL (Intermediate Language)**
3. ⚙️ The **CLR** loads the IL code at runtime
4. 🧠 The **JIT Compiler** translates IL into native machine code
5. 🧩 The code runs on your operating system with full runtime services
